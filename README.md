# XU4VideoCube
The video is decoded by the hardware h264 codec and then scaled and color space converted by the Mali GPU. The sample is purposely single threaded to better illustrate the process.

The spacebar toggles between quad and cube rendering. The escape key exits. A ready to run precompiled binary is in the ./bin folder.
